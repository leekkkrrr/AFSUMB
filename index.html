      <b>Figure1.</b> (a) Ultrafast images with the application of the
      Sub-Nyquist sampling method, rendering of 60,000 frames, and (b)
      conventional methods, illustrating the efficacy of the proposed technique
      in maintaining the resolution of high-resolution blood vessel images and
      visualized direction of blood flow images.
